__NB: This `scifio-itk-bridge` provides the _Java_ side of SCIFIO-ITK integration. For the _C++_ side, see [scifio-imageio](https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio).__

Provides a simple bridge class that can be called by an ITK ImageIO (C++) to pipe information to and from SCIFIO-based Readers and Writers (Java).

Instructions for use:
This project should be automatically downloaded by ITK. However, the `SCIFIOImageIO` is not enabled by default in ITK. To ensure its use, set the `ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH` environment variable to point to the `itkSCIFIOImageIO` after it's built.

NB: This is not an ITK-specific solution, and nothing in the Java code mandates the use of ITK. But as this solution uses pipes to communicate between C++ and Java, care must be taken in the formatting of this application's input and reading of the output. See also the [scifio-imageio](https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio) project, which implements the `itkSCIFIOImageIO` consuming the data produced by the `SCIFIOITKBridge`.
